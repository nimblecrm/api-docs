Parameters
----------

All parameters are optional. Unrecognized parameters are ignored. Unrecognized values will return an error.

**fields** — default: all fields in contact

  Specifies a comma separated list of fields to return. If this parameter is excluded, all fields will be returned. 
  For example: ``fields=first%20name,my%20custom%20field``. For more detailed info on Nimble's fields see :ref:`contact-fields`.

  .. note:: 
    If field name contains "," (comma) it should be shielded with "\\". For example: we have some custom field with name 
    "hello, Jon Doe" it should be HTML-encoded in ``hello%5C%2C%20John%20Doe`` (``hello\, John Doe``).

**tags** — default: 1

  Specifies whether tags should be included in the results. 


**per_page** — default: 30

**sort** — default: ``name:asc``

  Identifies the sort field and sort order. Sort order is required when this parameter is used. 
  An single sort field can be specified. Any field can be sorted in either ``asc`` or ``desc`` order.
  In addition to sorting on default, there are the special sorts: recently viewed by the authenticated 
  user (as ``recently%20viewed``), first + last name (as ``name``), and record created date (as ``create``).

  .. note:: 
    Only fields that have been indexed by our search engine are sortable. These include all custom fields and most standard fields.
