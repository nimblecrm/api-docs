.. _contacts-list-api:

=================
Get contacts list
=================

Request 
-------
For contacts listing we support two endpoints: base, returning full contact info, and ids-only endpoint that return only contact ids. Last one works faster then base one, so if you need only ids — please use it. 

Base endpoint::

    GET https://api.nimble.com/api/v1/contacts/
    
IDs endpoint::

    GET https://api.nimble.com/api/v1/contacts/ids/


Parameters
----------

All parameters are optional. Unrecognized parameters are ignored. Unrecognized values will return an error.

**fields** — default: all fields in contact

  Specifies a comma separated list of fields to return. If this parameter is excluded, all fields will be returned. 
  For example: ``fields=first%20name,my%20custom%20field``. For more detailed info on Nimble's fields see :ref:`contact-fields`.

  .. note:: 
    If field name contains "," (comma) it should be shielded with "\\". For example: we have some custom field with name 
    "hello, Jon Doe" it should be HTML-encoded in ``hello%5C%2C%20John%20Doe`` (``hello\, John Doe``).

**tags** — default: 1

  Specifies whether tags should be included in the results. 


**per_page** — default: 30

  Specifies the number of items to return per page of results.

**page** — default: 1

  Specifies which page to display. Numeration starts from 1. 

.. _contact_list_sorting:
**sort** — default: ``score:desc``

  Identifies the sort field and sort order. Sort order is required when this parameter is used. 
  An single sort field can be specified. Any field can be sorted in either ``asc`` or ``desc`` order.
  All :ref:`searchable fields <search-fields-list>` which aren't multiple  and aren't custom fields are sortable.
  Information about is field multiple can be retrieved from fields metadata. There are some notes for special fields:
